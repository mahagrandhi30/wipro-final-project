Bus Ticket Reservation System
This is a comprehensive project for a Bus Ticket Reservation System designed to address the challenges of manual ticketing, such as overbooking, revenue loss, and a poor customer experience. The system provides a centralized solution for managing buses, routes, schedules, and real-time seat inventory, and it enables online bookings, payments, and cancellations. The project is built with a 


Spring Boot backend and a React.js frontend, with a strong focus on security, performance, and user experience.

Core Features: 
The system is built around six core modules to provide a seamless experience for both customers and administrators:


Authentication & User Management: Secure login and registration with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based access control for admins and customers.



Bus & Route Management: Admins can manage bus details, seat layouts, routes, and stops.




Trip Scheduling & Seat Inventory: Admins can create date-specific trips, set fares, and the system tracks live seat availability to prevent double-booking.



Booking & Payment Processing: Customers can search for trips, hold seats temporarily, and process secure payments. The system handles payment callbacks and transactions for reliability.





Ticketing, Cancellations & Notifications: Automatically generates e-tickets with QR codes and PDF downloads. It also handles cancellations and refunds based on a defined policy.


Reports & Dashboards: Provides admins with crucial insights like sales summaries, occupancy rates, and route performance.
